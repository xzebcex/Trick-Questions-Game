## Conclusion
This code is a basic Python application that shows how to make a trick question game. It stores the questions and appropriate answers in a list of dictionaries, and it employs a simple scoring system to keep track of the user's progress. This project might be expanded in a variety of ways, such as by adding additional questions, developing a user interface, or including a timer to make the game more difficult.
